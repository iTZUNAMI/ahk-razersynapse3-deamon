## problem 1: 
sometimes the Razer Synapse 3 process (Windows) is stopped or blocked (not working correctly with the suspend/iberantion method of Windows)

at startup the software does not auto-close correctly

## Usage and key binding :

ALT GR + M 
to restart the application

at startup this script will auto-close all razer windows /spalsh startup
