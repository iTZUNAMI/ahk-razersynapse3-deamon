## problem 1: 
sometimes the Razer Synapse 3 process (Windows) is stopped or blocked (not working correctly with the suspend/hibernation method of Windows)

## problem 2: (now fixed on the client)
at startup the software does not auto-close correctly

## Usage and key binding :

ALT GR + M 
to restart the application, than the software will work again...

at startup this script will auto-close all razer windows /spalsh startup 

UPDATE:
CHANGING PATH OF THE PROCESS FOR THE NEW RAZER SYNAPSE
